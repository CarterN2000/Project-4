# Progressive Overachieving

## Project Overview
Progressive overachieving is a gym-tracker application that allows user to not-only track their daily workouts, but also provides users with the ability to search for their personal best from all of their exercises at any given time. A user can sign up for an account and begin tracking all of their workouts, as well as have access to many short articles designed to assist users with their fitness journey.

## Features List
- Ability to Login / Signup
- Access to Resource Articles
- Ability to Create / Edit / Delete Workouts
- Ability to add exercises with exercise details to the workout
- Ability to utilize searchbar which will return personal milestones from any given exercise

## Future Features
- Social System which will allow users to 'friend' other users and compare workouts
- 'BigCoin' - A fake currency designed to incentivize users to keep progressing in the gym. A certain number of coins is allotted every time a user beats a personal best at any given exercise. ALlows users to compare progress with others without focusing on what everyone else is doing in terms of just weight.
- Always more time to do extra styling!
